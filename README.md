Name: Richard Sugiharto

This code is an assignment for the human and computer interaction course in my Univerisity. The task of this assignment is to create a prototype using figma and website display using HTML, CSS, and Javascript for a watch shop called WatchcHGoods. I also attached a document containing the source of each image I used in this assignment.
